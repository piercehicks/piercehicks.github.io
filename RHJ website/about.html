<p>Rod Harris Jr. is a native of Jacksonville, Florida.  Rod was exposed to music at a young age by his singer/songwriter father.  When Rod was 14, his father decided to relocate the family to Atlanta, GA.  On his 17th birthday, his father gave him $150 dollars, and he decided to take the money and purchase an acoustic guitar.  Once he began learning the instrument he fell in love with it and was determined to be a great player.  After graduating and just a year of studying guitar, he applied for the Georgia State University School of Music, and was accepted.</p>

<p>It was at Georgia State University where his musical journey began.  During his freshman year in college Rod performed in the prestigious Atlanta Jazz Festival and also the following year. During his college years Rod began to enlist in many local bands not just jazz music but soul and gospel bands.  Rod graduated with surprisingly a B.B.A in Management and a Minor degree in Music. </p>

<p>After college, Rod continued playing at night and worked corporate America during the day. In 2006, Rod traveled to Nagoya, Japan to do a stint with a cover band at Gary's Motown Sound.  After returning to the U.S. he decided to leave "corporate america" and pursue music full time.   In 2008, he was called to do a summer tour with Atlantic Records recording artist Musiq Soulchild. Rod would go on to become the resident guitarist for Musiq (2008-present).   Also in 2008, Rod made an appearance in the motion picture film "Cadillac Records", starring Beyonce Knowles and Adrian Brody.  Rod also can be seen in the HBO biopic movie "Bessie" starring Queen Latifah.</p>

<p>Over his time as a guitarist, Rod has performed and recorded with countless artists and the list continues to grow.  Artists such as songstress Regina Belle, J. Holiday,  Miki Howard,  jazz trumpeter Russell Gunn,  Eightball and MJG,  Musiq Soulchild, Jagged Edge, Donell Jones, Lloyd, saxophonist Warren Hill and Paul Taylor, smooth jazz pianist Marcus Johnson, the legendary Fred Wesley,  jazz organist Doug Carn, Red Holloway (deceased), Ernie Andrews, Howard Hewitt of Shalamar , Malcolm-Jamal Warner, Maysa,  jazz trombonist Wycliffe Gordon, Joi, R & B Diva Syleena Johnson, Bishop Paul S. Morton, Grammy award winning singers Monica, Jennifer Holliday, Dionne Farris, and many others.</p>

<p>In addition to performing and touring, Rod has recently released his debut jazz-funk album  "The Counsel Of Elders" and is a founding member of the jazz/soul/funk collective known as SouthWesTerminal (Ropeadope Records) and the newly formed Rock/Fusion Power Trio known as The SYNATE.  Rod's music is available on all music internet stores (iTunes, Spotify, Rhapsody, etc.)  Rod's single, "How It Feels" which features Musiq Soulchild, has garnered acclaim amongst Underground DJs in the U.K., Japan, as well as the U.S.</p>
